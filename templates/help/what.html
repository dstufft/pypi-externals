  <h2>What Does All this Mean?</h2>
  <p>
    When pip or easy_install attempt to install a package they go to a special
    page on PyPI called the simple index (e.g. https://pypi.python.org/simple/apathy/).
  </p>
  <p>
    Once they go to the simple index for the desired package they read the links
    on that page. Any link with <code>rel="homepage"</code> or <code>rel="download"</code>
    on this simple index will also be visited.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once they have the contents of the simple index, and the contents of all the
    homepage and download links they process those contents looking for links that
    look like they are to installable files.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rules for what is an installable file are pretty arcane, but generally
    it is any url that looks like it's a download for a format the installer
    supports (e.g. http://example.com/apathy-1.0.tar.gz).
  </p>
  <p>
    Once it's found all the installable urls, it picks the best version it's found
    that matches what you've told it to install, downloads it, and installs it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Obviously scraping all of those homepage and download pages for external urls
    can take quite a long time. When selecting your Hosting Mode the first and
    second option tell PyPI to change the rel attributes to <code>ext-homepage</code>
    and <code>ext-download</code> which pip and easy_install will not scrape. This
    offers a pretty massive speedup in many cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whenever you upload a package to PyPI it processes the <code>long_description</code>
    or <code>README(.rst)</code> file and attempts to find urls. Any url it finds
    it will list on the packages simple index and if those urls look installable
    then installers will attempt to install them.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first Hosting Mode tells PyPI to no longer scan and automatically add
    urls to the simple index and to instead only list urls that you have explicitly
    told it too (and the uploaded files are always listed).
  </p>
  <p>
    The list of urls (if you have any) will contain all of the links that PyPI
    has scanned and extracted from your <code>long_description</code> and
    <code>README(.rst)</code> over time.
  </p>
